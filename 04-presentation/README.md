## Notes

### Window Surface

I guess I had already created the surface when I did WindowBuilder.

Added validation for the QueueFamily and Surface check.

Already have my queues from the Device.

### Swap Chain

Woot for `Arc`! Made this simpler than it could have been with the borrow checker.

### Image View

I'm not positive, but I think with `Vulkano` this was returned from `Swapchain::new`.
