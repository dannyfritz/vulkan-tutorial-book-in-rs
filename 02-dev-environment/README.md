# Dev Environment

## Notes

This guide is telling you how to setup Vulkan with C++ on Windows and Linux.
Download and install the Vulkan SDK.
Run an example binary from the SDK to verify Vulkan.
Download GLFW to use as a windowing library.
Download GLM to use for math.
Setup Visual Studio.
Create a project in Visual Studio.
Copy and paste some code and run it to test the dev environment.
Configure the project to be less spammy with warnings.
Repeat instructions for Linux.

## Random Thoughts

This is a good demonstration of why I like Rust a lot more than C++.
It involves a ton of copying files around, downloading SDK's, setting up paths, and configuring Visual Studio.
In Rust I'm going to be adding 4 words and 4 versions to my Cargo.toml and I'm ready to code.
Then in the crate, run `cargo build`.
That's it.
It will even work on both Windows and Linux out of the box.
